Declarative Chart Library
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaosmail/dchart.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaosmail/dchart)

This library is an extensible declarative Chart Library written in typescript. The goal was to build a chart library, which lets you easily declare the chart pieces whithout having to hack the same d3.js functions all the time.

Demos and Docs can be found here: http://chaosmail.at/2013/dchart/

I will integrate dChart to be used with jQuery (see ...) and AngularJS ([see this Repo](https://github.com/chaosmail/angular-dchart)) when this lib is stable.

Example-Usage
-------------
```javascript

var functionChart1 = new dChart.LineChart({
    elem: 'functionChart1',
    width:700,
    height:400,
    label: "Dataset: Function Example",
    axis: {
        x: {
            label: "x axis",
            align: "center"
        },
        y: {
            label: "y axis"
        }
    },
    dataSets: [
        {
            label: "Dataset: Function 'sin'",
            lineStyle: {
                stroke: "red",
                strokeWidth: 2
            },
            dataFn: {
                fn: Math.sin,
                min: 0,
                max: 2*Math.PI,
                step: Math.PI/360
            }
        },
        {
            label: "Dataset: Function 'cos'",
            lineStyle: {
                stroke: "blue",
                strokeWidth: 2
            },
            dataFn: {
                fn: Math.cos,
                min: 0,
                max: 2*Math.PI,
                step: Math.PI/360
            }
        }
    ]
});
```
