=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaosmail/dchart.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaosmail/dchart)
**Warning! This is not useable yet!**

This library is a extensible declarative vanillajs Chart Library written in typescript.
It also can be used with jQuery (see ...) or AngularJS ([see this Repo](https://github.com/chaosmail/angular-dchart))

Example-Usage

```javascript

var lineChart1 = new dChart.LineChart({
    elem: 'lineChart1',
    width: 400,
    height: 400,
    label: "My awesome Chart",
    description: "This awesome chart lib is using D3.js",
    axis: {
        x: {
            label: "x-Axis"
        },
        y: {
            label: "y-Axis",
            range: [0,1]
        }
    },
    dataSets:[
        {
            label: "Dataset 1: Points",
            stroke: "#ff0000",
            data: [
                {x:0,y:0},
                {x:1,y:0.5},
                {x:2,y:0.7},
                {x:3,y:0.85},
                {x:4,y:0.9},
                {x:5,y:0.92}
            ]
        },
        {
